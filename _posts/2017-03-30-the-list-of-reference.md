  아마존에서 검색하면 가장 상위에 나오는 책. 리뷰 별점도 상등급이고, Quora에도 가장 상위에 랭크되어 있는 책으로 더 마음에 드는 것은 3판이 출판한지 얼마되지 않아서, _2017.02.09_, 최신 내용을 담고 있다는 점. (4.4 Kitkat ~ 7.0 Nuogat) 총 624 페이지로 양이 꽤 되지만, 가장 많이 보는 책인 것 같다. 아마존에 달린 별 하나 짜리 리뷰를 보면 괜히 시간낭비하는 것은 아닐지 고민이 된다.

  > Quora #1
  > Bill Philips and Brian Hardy offer hands-on tips for practical Android development. The book starts with basic steps involved in learning android development and progresses in an excellent manner. The book is written in a conversational style and feels like a personal tutor. Beginners can test their development skills with the exercises given at the end of every chapter.

  > Quora #2:
  > I used this book to get from ground zero to launching my first, fully-functional app on the Play Store in 2-3 months (while working a full-time job).  This book covers all four major Android app components (Activities, Services, BroadcastReceivers, ContentProviders) in great detail and also goes into networking, maps, etc.
  > This book includes various "Challenges" at the end of each chapter that ask the user to further implement/enhance some of the concepts that were previously discussed in the chapter.
  > The best part about this book is that the writers have a very upbeat, user-friendly, and easy-to-follow style of explaining the concepts.

  > Amazon 별 1개 리뷰:
  > One of the most poorly written programming books. They need to change their "We Write" tab, on their website, to "We try to write but fail miserably". If you want to learn programing like paint by numbers and waste a lot of time, this is for you. They condescendingly tell you that their way of programing is the best way when it is just their way. They give very short "explanations" of their code. Not much on why they do something just how. Only positive about this book is that they cover a lot of topics, but they do so poorly.

  리뷰 횟수는 이 책이 Big nerd보다는 많고 페이지가 얼마 안되서 (50 페이지 정도) 빠르게 한번 쭉 읽기 좋은 책으로 생각됨 - 읽어보고 업데이트 필요
  > Amazon 별 1개 리뷰:
  > Please don't buy it, it's fake!! It's only 54 of what an Android app is made of. No single code, no XML code, no single screen shot. I want my money back!!!!
  > All the other reviews are fake too

  > Amazon 별 5개 리뷰:
  > This book is good. Very good. I have an android tablet that I bought 5-6 months ago and although I know other programming languages, until now I had no idea of how to create an android application. So I bought this 5 bucks book and in less than 2 hours I read about half of it. And, big miracle, now I know about all about how to create an android application. It has inside everything you need to know if you never, ever had the slightest idea on how to program an Android application. Some reviews here say that there are typos, or that this book does not contain a single line of code. Nothing more false. I prefer to spend 5 bucks on a very good book of 45 pages from which I can easily learn (even if it has 5-7 typos in it) that give 20 bucks on a 200 pages book about android development that I will never read completely.
  > These 5 bucks for a 4-5 hour read that made me a good android developer are the best investment that I made in the last months.Thank you.
